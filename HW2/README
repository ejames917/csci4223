Functions adapted from ex9


Key bindings:
m          Toggle between persepctive and orthogonal
d          Change displays
x          Toggle axes
f          Toggle FPS on/ (Takes prescident over orthogonal/perspective)
+/-        Changes field of view for perspective
arrows     Change view angle in Orthographic and Perspecive mode
WASD       Move around in FPS mode
PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
0          Reset view angle
ESC        Exit

This took me about 7 hours to complete.

There is a setting when cycling through the display features which randomly generates cylinders.
I was not able to figure out how to get this to work properly, because it regenerates the random
cylinders every time a key is pressed. I am planning on using this type of random generation in my 
final project, to help make a game.

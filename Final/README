Overall, I ended up with a finished product not too far from what I originally had in mind. I was able to make a realistic looking arcade machine and skee-ball machine, both of which implement curved surfaces. For the arcade machine, I took your advice and implemented a Bezier curve which was interesting to figure out. Ideally, I would have implemented at least one playable game when the user interacts with the arcade machines, but I didn't have enough time. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to get any interactive functionality added. It was much harder than I expected to be able to do something as seemingly simple as rolling a ball down the skee-ball track. This was one of the major hangups I ran into and sunk a lot of time, in an attempt to understand where I was going wrong. It may be something I come back to in the future and play with some more after I have some time to chew on the problem. I would also like to clean up some of the aesthetics, including giving the machines rounded corners. This was another thing I was tinkering with, but never got it implemented to my liking.

I also was able to use this project as a chance to brush up on my linear algebra skills. I think I understand how to calculate surface normals better now than when I was actually taking a linear algebra class. 

My favorite aspect of my project is how surprisingly good looking the arcade cabinets are. I went through two more iterations which I ended up scrapping because I thought they looked ugly. After implementing the Bezier curve, I was much happier with the appearance. 

Stepping away from my hard work and looking critically, I am surprised at how simple everything looks compared to the hours of work I put in to finish this project. There really is something to say about the complexity of computers and how difficult it is to have everything work properly. 

Thank you for a great summer semester! It's hard to cram so much learning into such a short amount of time, but I definitely am coming away from the class smarter than when I entered.
